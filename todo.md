1. how can I make interchangeable arguments of Order initialize?
2. with new function make sure that Order initialize arguments are the correct type of element
3. do I need to have a SummaryOrder class? Maybe is just a method on LiveOrderBoard.
4. should I need to specified that #remove_order on LiveOrderBoard
class will only receive user_id, otherwise it is going to send an error message.
5. refactor live_order_board_spec.rb
