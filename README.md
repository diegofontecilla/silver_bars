## About the result

I didnt finish the tech test with all the specifications. At the moment, the user can print SELL and BUY order list, but not in the required order and with a repetion of the orders with same price per kl.
I need to finish these tasks and also refine summary_spec unit tests in order not to print undesirable info when running rspec.
The Summary class needs refactoring and testing.
